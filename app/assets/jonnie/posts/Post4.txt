<p>Since it seems like every time an amazing publisher like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'reilly_" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_Of_Ed" target="_blank">Friends of Ed</a> comes out with a new Flex book I am so excited I need to rush to the nearest Borders books or Barnes and Nobles, to purchase this new &amp;quot;amazing&amp;quot; book. Little to my knowledge to know what is in store for me.</p>  <p>Upon getting home, to open up my new book and read over the chapters, and then it happens, another Flex book, with nothing to benefit from it, I don't understand while these top authors and publishers keep coming out with basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex" target="_blank">Flex</a> books, it's all beginner information, nothing advanced in there, I'm sure by now everyone knows how to drag a panel to the main application and absolute position it.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Don't get me wrong it's not just Flex books; it seems to be the same with a lot of different languages. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php" target="_blank">Php</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax" target="_blank">Ajax</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rails" target="_blank">rails</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actionscript" target="_blank">ActionScript</a>, etc.) Trust me I admire what those authors do but... am I the only programmer that likes these beginner books? It seems like that every time a Flex book comes out, it is just the same old' thing but with different pictures, and in different words.</p> </blockquote>  <p>When will someone release a Flex book that from chapter 1 it shows you how to set up a new project with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborb" target="_blank">WebORB</a> for PHP, and detailed for that matter, not one of those one line references to the creators' web site for documentation, you can't find anything useful there. Instead of wasting a chapter on installing Flex builder, then another chapter on setting up your first project, and then one more on displaying current web sites that are using Flex. Save the paper that you would waste on those 3 chapters and create some great ones.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Like</p>    <ul>     <li>&amp;quot;Creating You Own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api" target="_blank">API</a> Service Class for Google&amp;quot; </li>      <li>&amp;quot;Connecting to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordpress_" target="_blank">Wordpress </a>through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml-rpc" target="_blank">XML-RPC</a>&amp;quot; </li>      <li>&amp;quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest" target="_blank">REST</a> Calls to Del.icio.us&amp;quot; </li>      <li>&amp;quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post" target="_blank">POST</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" target="_blank">ATOM</a> to the Server&amp;quot; </li>      <li>&amp;quot;Extending ActionScript Classes&amp;quot; </li>      <li>&amp;quot;Creating Your Own Library&amp;quot;        <br /></li>   </ul> </blockquote>  <p>That is a book that I am sure developers will be lined up to buy, I know I would. Does that make me an advanced programmer? No, but it does make me want to extend my skills to doing/creating usefully applications that an everyday Internet user will be able to use, including myself.</p>  <p>With that said, I have decided to take things into my own hands, it's time to create a book ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> ).</p>  <p>Here are a few questions that you're probably asking yourself. (Hopefully)</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Q: When is it going to be released? </strong></li>    <li>     <div>A: I have no idea, with the help of you, sooner than later.        <br /></div>   </li>    <li><strong>Q: How much will it cost?</strong> </li>    <li>     <div>A: Free! I am a fan of open source        <br /></div>   </li>    <li><strong>Q: Great so how can I help?</strong> </li>    <li>     <div>A: Well send me an email and we can discuss some of the details on plan of attack, I have a set number of chapters, but that can always change.        <br /></div>   </li>    <li><strong>Q: Why are you/we doing this?</strong> </li>    <li>A: Because it will be fun, beneficial, helpful, and a great tool to add to any Flex developers pocket book. Why not, what else would I/you be doing if we didn't create something like this? Starting projects and never finishing them, because I know that's what I would be doing. Let's be productive, and create something useful.      <br /></li> </ul>  <p>So send me a message, and join me on creating this, I you don't want to help that's ok too. I still am going to create this, so check back often to see which chapters are completed and which ones are left.</p>  <p>Thanks for letting me get that steam off my chest.</p>
