# SmartApp™  
Allows you configure your app

#### Problem

Users need to be able to update the screens that are visible in the application and most of all, the contents of that screen. Information changes and peoples minds change, so having a way to manage the display of the application is a must.


#### Solution

The SmartApp module enables a few sub-module classes to allow the user to manage the screens in there application, the contents of that screen, the style of that screen and more. Developers can manage the screens of the application, the Templates that the Screens use for displaying content, and the SmartApp Builder which allows a developer to drag and drop custom templates (pre-defined or custom) to the screens content section, build and test.
