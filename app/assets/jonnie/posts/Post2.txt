First off I would like it has been awhile since my last post and that is because I have just started school, but i continue to work on all of my projects. Anyways here is a little update on some.



Flexpattern ( Textpattern Flex Admin )

Last night I was up to the crack of dawn trying to figure out why I kept getting a compiler error, of stack overflow, I found that bug and decided to call it a night. Then today after I cleaned up all of the code from before ( which by the way was horrible, and i am sorry for presenting that to you all ) I just kept running into alot of backend errors, and it was really frustrating. Anyways, I am going to post some updated interface pics and hopefully a demo.



Flexpress ( Wordpress Flex Admin )

This is going great, just besides the fact of the whole saving posts and stuff. I want to some how be able to use the xml-rpc to do all of the posts with comments and tags, but i have been too busy to figure that out. I will post some pics and demos of this as well.
