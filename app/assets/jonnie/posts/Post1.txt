<p>Its been awhile since I have been on this thing and I apologize, I have just started my Fall semester of school and things have been kind of busy. But I will still finish my tutorials that I have started and my projects. I just don't know when.</p>  <p>Anyway's Here is the schedule for this week.</p>  <p>Thursday is my 22nd birthday, and It also is the day of my Flex User Group meeting, which I will be presenting on Amfphp and Flex.</p>  <p>If anyone is around the Sacramento/Fair Oaks area, please join us as it will be a fun night with a lot of learning involved, :).</p>  <p>I am going to be posting the exact location and time of the event, so if you want anymore information please check back in a day or so. Also this presentation hopefully will be recorded, and I will make a pod cast or something from it. I am really nervous, but yet excited at the same time. </p>  <p>Wish me luck</p>
