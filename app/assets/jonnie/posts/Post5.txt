<p>I am going to be posting all of my flex projects that I have created, and not finished over the last year. Hopefully by tonite, about 4 am I will have them all up and running for all to see. I have to install textpattern, drupal, weborb, amfphp, and set up alot of databases, its not going to be fun but I need to do it. Anyways I just want to post a heads up to all so you can have something to look forward to tonite, and for this weekend. I want to chat with a few people about maybe teaming up these little pointless projects so we can get use to working with teams, and svn from flex builder, also let me know if your interested. I am going to be working hard all night getting this stuff set up, with folder structures, renaming classes... etc. O before I forget to say all of these will be open to who ever.</p>  <p>These projects/examples include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Flex and Textpattern integration with amfphp</li>    <li>Flex and Drupal full administration interface with the amfphp services module</li>    <li>Flex and WebORB for PHP a bunch of fun examples</li>    <li>Flex and Twitter through the amfphp</li>    <li>Travel Journal, a integration with flex, php, mysql, amfphp, yahoo maps, etc.</li>    <li>Media Manager, another integration with flex and php. This includes multi-file upload, and display, video upload, and display, snippet panel, etc.</li>    <li>Website Manager, flex and weborb team up to bring together somelike a text editor and ftp for editing files on the service, like those stupid config.php files you have to manually upload when creating/installing cms's or blogging software.</li>    <li>Flexible Docs, a mix of rails and flex to bring out the REST in us, this lets you create notes, tasks, snippets, uploads, etc.</li> </ul>  <p>Hmm, I think I forgot a few also, I will update the list when I get back tonite. <em>( Going away dinner :/ )</em></p>
