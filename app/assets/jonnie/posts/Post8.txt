<p>Welcome to Jonnie on Flex, I have some great things in store  for the days ahead; here is the weekly line up of topics that will be covered  every week.

<ul>

    <li><strong>Manic Monday: </strong>Where I will be discussing the latest Flex  news and events.</li>

    <li><strong>Tutorial Tuesday: </strong>Where every Tuesday I will have a new  great Flex tutorial available.</li>

    <li><strong>What the Flex Wednesday:</strong> You know when you get stuck with an  error in your Flex application, you are saying to yourself "What the Flex?"  Well I am going to have Flex trouble shooting every Wednesday.</li>

    <li><strong>Theme Thursday:</strong> I will be discovering new Flex themes and  links for downloading these themes, as well as a hefty review for them.</li>
