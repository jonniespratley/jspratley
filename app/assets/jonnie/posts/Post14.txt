<p>I suggest any student out there that wants to get Flex Builder 3 Pro for FREE head over to <a href="https://freeriatools.adobe.com/">Free RIA Tools at Adobe</a>. All you have to do is send in three things.</p>  <ol>   <li>School ID</li>    <li>School Schedule</li>    <li>Photo ID</li> </ol>  <p>I am not positive about the photo id, but I sent in my licence and I received a email the next day, I guess it just speeds up the process. They also have Coldfusion 8 on there as well and I just got a copy yesterday, so I am excited to start tinkering with Coldfusion.</p>  <p>&amp;#160;</p>  <p>Head over there now </p>  <p><a href="https://freeriatools.adobe.com/">Free RIA Tools at Adobe</a></p>
