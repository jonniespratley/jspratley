## Interview »


### + Can you introduce yourself?

My name is Jonnie Spratley and I am currently working for a business in Rocklin, CA called AppMatrix; I started using HTML, PHP and JavaScript around 2004 and become addicted every since, I spent several years working with the Flex Framework, Flash, ActionScript 3 and a variety of server-side languages. In 2012 I  came back to using HTML5, CSS3, client-side JavaScript frameworks Backbone.js, Angular.js  and server-side JavaScript using Node.js, MongoDB and Express.

Lately I've been focused on starting and guiding new product design and development at AppMatrix. As part of that, I built an initial prototype showing off some ideas around custom content management systems for mobile applications, graphical analytic ROI interfaces, drag and drop mobile application wizards and agile development practices to streamline the current workflow. Those prototypes eventually formed the seed of the ****, which has aided in design, development and managing of over 30 apps in the Apple AppStore and Google Marketplace.



### + What motivates you the most about web technologies?
I am motivated by how fast web technologies are becoming more and more developer friendly, tools that help developers create beautiful projects faster that are scalable and testable, code is here to stay, but how you create it, deploy it and test it can always be improved, that is my motivation.



### + Do you have client-side web technology experience?
I have many years in both production and development environments using the latest and greatest client-side web technologies, including the following:

* JavaScript
* XHTML / HTML5 / CSS3
* Flash
* Ajax
* Backbone.js
* Angular.js
* Ember.js
* jQuery / jQuery UI / jQuery Mobile
* Twitter Bootstrap

### + Do you have server-side web technology experience?
I also have many years in both production and development environments using a variety of server-side programming languages including the following:

* Node.js
* PHP
* Ruby on Rails
* ColdFusion
* MySQL
* MongoDB
* XML-RPC / JSON-RPC

 

### + How do you challenge the status quo in software engineering?
I challenge the existing state of affairs in software engineering by formulating patterns to streamline the current processes in software development, not reinventing the wheel but reinventing how long and well the wheels roll. 


### + Do you have a strong affinity for collaboration with other developers?
I have a natural ability to communicate complex software development practices and patterns to other developers in a way that enables them to understand and retain information provided, I have done many user group presentations regarding Application Architecture, Custom Components, and Enterprise application development using various application frameworks and platforms. I have published 2 articles for  Flash Developers Magazine and have written many tutorials and cookbooks for other developers to learn.


### + What is your history of solving issues in development productivity?
I have history in solving issues in development productivity dating back to June of 2009, when I released an open source project called [CodeGen](https://code.google.com/p/flex-codegen/), with 700+ downloads this project enabled developers to scaffold 100% both client-side and server-side code from a structured XML document.    

In January of 2013 I launched the ****** which consists of 5 sub-applications that enables mobile application developers to design, develop, deploy and manage mobile applications created with a variety of todays cutting edge technologies including the Titanium Platform, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile and standard HTML5 / CSS3.


### + Do you design/develop libraries to streamline development?
I have designed and developed many mobile application wizards, mobile RPC libraries, server-side frameworks, custom content management systems, 3rd party API libraries, and database utilities for generating, automating, testing and streamlining projects from concept to production using a tailored agile development practice suited for the current situation.


### + Do you commit to code hygiene, readable code and testability?
I am a object-oriented programmer and take pride in all code that I write, I focus on using industry coding standards, formatting, indentation, documentation, code examples, tutorials and demo applications with source view enabled. I write code in a way that tells a story about the application or task, all of my code is usable, readable and testable using the latest frameworks available.

 
 

### + Are you optimistic, easy-going, and fun to be with?
I am very optimistic, easy-going and fun to be with. I believe that actions speak louder than words, so when it comes to personality traits, I tend to leave that to the eye of the beholder.
