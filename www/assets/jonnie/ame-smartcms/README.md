Mobile loyalty is at the forefront of all digital marketing efforts today. With the built-in coupon module, retailers and brick and mortars can provide timely and relevant coupon and promotional offerings right thru the CMS. Use incentives to build your mobile database thru the coupon deck or drive added revenue during those slow business hours with other limited time offers. Think of it as your own private Groupon. Track and trace redemptions thru multiple campaigns. Integrate your coupons with QR codes and your POS systems.

SMS/Text messaging has been a big success for many digital marketers, but as mobile continues to evolve at both the hardware and software levels, so do the media formats. Some experts say within 3 to 5 years (most likely sooner) we will be communicating on mobile devices primarily thru live video feeds (i.e. FaceTime or Skype). If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is a novel, and the delivery of rich media thru the mobile channel will continue to expand mobile engagement in the years to come. 

The SmartCMS provides a simple drag and drop system to upload videos to display within the app. And even though it integrates with 3rd party video accounts such as YouTube or Vimeo it is not a requirement.
